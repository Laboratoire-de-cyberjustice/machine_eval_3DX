tripo:
  model_version: 'v2.5-20250123'  # Tripo model version 'v1.4-20240625'-old model, good for starters, but we need to capture the shape, 'v3.0-20250812' for advances, 'Turbo-v1.0-20250506' fast but not good quality, 'v2.5-20250123' might be good as a mid tier - might be good for geometry,
  texture: true                    # Generate textures
  pbr: true                        # Generate PBR materials

  # Advanced parameters for exact image matching
  texture_alignment: "original_image"  # Match original appearance, can change to 'geometry' or 'original_image'
  texture_quality: "detailed"          # High-res textures - 'detailed', 'standard'
  geometry_quality: "detailed"         # Ultra Mode (v3.0+)
  orientation: "align_image"           # Match camera angle
  auto_size: false                     # Keep original proportions

  # API Rate Limits (from Tripo AI documentation)
  limits:
